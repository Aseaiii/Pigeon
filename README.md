# A Seq2Seq Multistep Prediction Model with TCN and Temporal Attention for Environmental Temperature in Pigeon Sheds

## Dataset Introduction

The architecture of the IoT, depicted in Figure, provides access via a web or app interface, allowing the monitoring of real-time environmental conditions within the pigeon shed. The environmental parameters it collected include light intensity, carbon dioxide (CO2), temperature, total suspended particulates (TSP), relative humidity, PM2.5, PM10, ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and noise levels.
